# Setup

- [Install Brew](https://brew.sh/#install)
- [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

## Demo and Sample Data

1. `cp .env-example .env`

2. When not running the [case-issue-api](https://github.com/usds/case-issue-api) you    need to generate appropriate stub data, you can run the following commands:

    ```bash
    mkdir src/sample_data
    python jsonizer.py --fake -n 300 > src/sample_data/i90_old.json
    ```

    Alternatively, if you have non-fake data in the CSV format that `jsonizer.py`
    expects, you can run a similar command to get more realistic-looking output.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### CI-checks

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
```

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn coverage`

Launches the test runner and collects code coverage. Outputs results to the `/coverage` directory.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### BaseUrl Environment Variable

By default, the base URL is assumed to be the local Spring back-end url, `http://localhost:8080`. If building for a different environment, simply add the `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` environment variable. For example, if the API is located at `https://truffles-api.app.cloud.gov`, you could build the application using the following command:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://truffles-api.app.cloud.gov yarn build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn deploy`

This is a local customization: it will attempt to deploy the application to cloud.gov
(you will need to be logged in to your cloud.gov sandbox account to do this).

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
