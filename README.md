# Search Party Case Tracker

Search Party case tracker is an open source, API-enabled web table for aggregating, triaging and tracking exceptions within a case processing system. Search party is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), and the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).



**This project is being actively maintained.**

Based on the experience and interviews with pilot users, we're considering scaling the design incorporating feedback with additional (but similar) use cases. 

If you're interested in helping us design and build Search Party’s future iterations please [open an issue](https://github.com/usds/case-issue-navigator/issues)!



### About this project

Search Party enhances an adjudicator’s workflow, tracking complex or unconventional (“exception”) cases moving through a digital case processing system that often fall victim to delayed processing times or remain unadjudicated due to lack of visibility or low priority.

In addition to providing visibility to these stuck cases, Search Party collects data from the user’s actions exposing new insights about the type and proportion of reasons that a case may be more likely to become an exception. 



### Getting Started

For information about setting up and using Search Party, see the *Search Party*[ *Documentation*](https://github.com/usds/case-issue-navigator/blob/master/docs/README.md).
